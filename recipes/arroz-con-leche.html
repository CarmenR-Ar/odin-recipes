    <h3>Spanish Arroz con Leche</h3>
    <p>Arroz con leche is a flavorful dessert with a long history, dating back to the period when Spain was under the Moorish influence. Today, this rice pudding is popular in Spain (especially in the North) and throughout Latin America.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk, 1 liter</li>
        <li>Rice, 100 gr</li>
        <li>Sugar, 70 gr</li>
        <li>Grated lemon peel, 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Cinnamon, 1 stick</li>
        <li>Vanilla, 1/2 stick</li>
        <li>Cinnamon powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the rice with either water (or for a more creamy version, with milk) and bring to a simmer along with the cinnamon stick and lemon rind.</li>
        <li>When the liquid is almost fully absorbed, add more milk to cover the rice again. Keep simmering and stirring, adding more milk every time the rice gets dry.</li>
        <li>When you have added almost the full liter, start to taste the rice. You want it fully cooked, but some people like it a little more firm than others. It is a matter of preference.</li>
        <li>When it is to your liking, take it off the heat. Add a pinch of salt, a dash of cinnamon, and add the sugar little by little until it is the perfect sweetness for you. Enjoy your pudding warm or chill it in the fridge in small serving dishes for a couple of hours and eat it cold.</li>
